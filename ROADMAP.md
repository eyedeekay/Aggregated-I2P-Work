My Roadmap/Checklist
--------------------

### Split tunnel configs/Self-installing services

 1. Split configuration directories for i2ptunnel and other applications as appropriate
  * In-Progress.
 2. Self-installing client/service demos for nginx(server only), ssh/sshd, and Mattermost client/server using split i2ptunnel configuration and apt
  * Done, but depends on Split Configurations for i2ptunnel.

### Begin re-creating an I2P Distro

 1. Port any maintainable, i2p-native bittorrent client to be apt-get installable in Debian, likely BiglyBT or XD
  * Done, but not by me, I just fixed a little script. R4S4S did all the substantial work.
 2. Produce ISO for "I2P Linux Distro Redux" Project using these features
  * In-Progress.

### Applications, clients, and libraries

 1. Browser tunnel identity management UI WebExtension for i2p Browser build
  * Nearly done.
 2. Extended SOCKS Proxy with WebExtension Native Messaging features for i2p Browser build and general use
  * In Progress.
 3. Create .deb package for Extended SOCKS proxy for PPA/Project Repo
  * Not started, maybe not necessary.
 4. goSam - Up to SAM 3.2, better default signatures.
  * Done.
 5. sam3 - Up to SAM 3.2, better default signatures. Streaming, datagrams, and raw. General improvements.
  * Done, but still growing.
 6. jsam - Further development
  * Not started, but easy.
